    Welcome to the Wisco Wanderers! This is your go to place for the down low on creepy lore and historical sites
    located throughout the Wisconsin area. Think of it like Buzzfeed Unsolved except if you swap the two guys for cool
    and broke college girls that are confined to the Wisconsin area due to lack of funds and transportation. Riveting, I
    know. If you’re still here after that lovely cold opening, congrats because you’re in for a wild ride filled with
    “haunted” sites, cold cases, and brutalist architecture.
