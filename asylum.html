<h1>Welcome to the Sheboygan Falls Asylum</h1>
<h2>(Cat Toys, Fireball, and Spirit Boxes, Oh My!)</h2>
<div>
    <p class="p-center pinker-background"> Okay so in theory, exploring an abandoned asylum sounds really freaking cool.
        One
        of the highest levels of
        badassery. And in some ways it is. <i>But here’s my counter offer:</i> I’m scared of trespassing. Not
        trespassing
        itself
        but getting caught, and fined, and getting a citation blah blah blah. So what are our loopholes here? How do I
        get
        in the abandoned Sheboygan Falls Asylum legally? <b>Answer</b>: sign up for a guided ghost tour of the place at
        night. And
        that’s exactly what I did after roping a fellow wanderer to go with me on a mini ghost road trip. Lemme tell
        you,
        walking through that asylum in the dark was really trippy. But the people that I was on tour with? Crazier than
        anything I saw that night.

        Let me preface this by saying that I’m not one to really believe in the supernatural, I just think going to
        creepy
        sites and exploring is fun. So no, I don’t think I felt any ghostly presence or saw any specters in the air.
        However, the tour guides and the people on tour were paranormal in it of themselves. They wholeheartedly
        believed
        that they were talking to
        ghosts. Which I won’t judge them for. But let me run you through a list of reasons why I think this ghost tour
        was
        absolutely not haunted and why the people on this tour were kinda, maybe, very <i>delusional</i>.

                home. <b>Cat toys.</b>
                The
                guides would
                throw cat toys down a hallway. If they lit up, then it had to be because of a spiritual presence.
                Definitely
                not
                because the technology behind cat toys is highly archaic and sensitive to any movement. We would
                genuinely
                stand
                in the dark and stare in silence to see if the cat toys would light up due to a “ghost” entering the
                room.
                Bizarre, just bizarre.

            <dd>A beverage every college kid is well acquainted with. I’ll bet you’ll never guess who else is well
                acquainted
                with Fireball. The ghosts of Sheboygan Falls Asylum (allegedly). Imagine my surprise when my group is
                touring
                the boiler room of the asylum and I see a mini shrine of Fireball shooters on the ground. As the
                observant
                person I am, I ask what those are. To which the guide tells me that the “ghosts of old maintenance
                workers”
                informed her that they wanted Fireball, and so they made a Fireball shrine. Let’s do a mini history
                lesson.
                This
                asylum was open from 1876 to 1940. Fireball wasn’t popular in the US until the mid-2000s. I’m just going
                to
                say
                it out loud. The “ghosts” do not want Fireball. They had no idea what Fireball was, they were before its
                time.
                Unless the “ghosts” are susceptible to advertising and peer pressure, I think the group was under the
                influence
                of a hefty dose of delusion, not Fireball.

        <dd>
            That ole beaut was allegedly how the tour guides knew the ghosts wanted
            Fireball.
            For those of you unfamiliar with spirit boxes, let me explain it to you based on what the tour guides told
            me
            when I
            asked. The Spirit Box flips through a bunch of AM radio stations (since it was night and there were less
            people
            active on AM stations) very quickly. So normally you won’t hear words or phrases strung together - unless a
            spirit
            is trying to make contact with you. Okay, cool, makes sense if you maybe believe in that type of thing. So
            then
            the
            guides and fellow people on tour would ask the spirit box questions and wait for the radio to reveal some
            answers
            from beyond the grave. Let me give you an example of how this dialgue would usually roll out.

            <br/>
            <br/>
            <b>Hello. Can you tell us how many of you are in the room with us?</b>
            <br/>
            <i>Dfkjghdkghwkf</i>

            <br/>
            <br/>

            <b>3? There are 3 presences in the room?</b>
            <br/>
            <i>Dsfhsdkjfhskdjfhadhof</i>

            <br/>
            <br/>

            <b>Okay. Can you tell me your names?</b>
            <br/>
            <i> Kdjfhdkhfksdnf</i>
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <b> I think I heard the name Dave. Is that correct? </b>
            <br/>
            <i> Sedjkfnwkejfwgj jfkwedhsfkewj </i>

            <br/>
            <br/>


            Notice anything? Let me give it to you straight. The spirit box is a potent shot of placebo. Maybe
            half-formed
            words
            or
            almost-phrases would come from the spirit box occasionally, but that makes sense since its stringing
            together
            vowels
            and
            different consonants from the radio station. The responses from the spirit box to the above questions
            produced
            exactly what you saw. Unintelligible garbage. The people on tour were listening to the box so hard and
            wanting
            to
            hear something so bad, their ears started playing tricks on them. No, the “ghost” didn’t say their name was
            Dave,
            and no there were not 3 other “ghosts” in the room. All there was were random muffled sounds emitted from a
            technological waste of time and a group of people desperate to experience something. I rest my case.

        <dd class="black-text">Do I regret going? No, of course not. The abandoned asylum was a great place to explore,
            especially at
            night. Do I regret going <i> with the ghost tour </i>? Again, no. They were honestly really entertaining and
            more
            ominous than anything I saw in the corridors of the asylum. Wherever my tour group is right now, I hope
            they’re having fun with their cat toys, Fireball, and spirit boxes.
