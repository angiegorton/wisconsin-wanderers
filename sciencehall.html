<h1>Enter Science Hall if You Dare</h1>

    Science Hall. We all know the one. That creepy red building right next to Memorial Union on UW Madison’s campus. To
    some, it's another building that houses their respective discussions and lecture halls. To others, it's a vessel for
    insidious forces. Surprisingly, I never had a reason to go into Science Hall, even after being on campus for 2
    years. That is until now, when I braved the building on a random Tuesday night.

<p class="p-right skinny-width">

    First things first, let’s address the allegations. According to <a
        href="https://uwalumni.com/news/haunted-history-the-legend-of-science-hall/"> this UW Madison alumni </a>, tons
    of strange occurrences
    have historically gone down in Science Hall. Which for the record has a misleading name since the only people
    populated in
    Science Hall since the fifties are the cartography and geography students. Regardless, some of
    these incidents include a mad scientist with an attic laboratory, strange feelings in the hallways, the sounds of
    footsteps, and the like. Again, just cliché heebee jeebee jargon with not a lot of facts to back it up. The only
    true story I could find was that at one point in 1974 some cartography students were cleaning a room on the 4th
    floor, found a way inside the attic, and discovered an embalmed foot. The dramatics of this story are dispelled when
    you
    realize anatomy students used to occupy the upper floors of Science Hall back in the day and just did a poor job
    when it came to moving all of their materials after relocating to a different building on campus.

    <br/><br/>

    My thoughts on Science Hall? The architecture is fascinating to look at. I walked around almost every square
    inch of the building I could find. There’s a lot of strange little half doors littered throughout the building.
    Sure, they were a little weird. I can’t think of any explanation for why they exist, and couldn’t get any closure
    since every door I tried to open was locked. But still, this was not enough to warrant a haunting for me. There was
    a
    pretty sick golden elevator I rode to the 4th floor. From there you can see the attic lab of the “Mad Scientist”,
    but it's inaccessible because the stairs to get up there were locked. The most bizarre thing I saw was a door in
    between the third and fourth floors. It was half sized like the other ones, and regardless of the fact that I have
    no idea how anyone would get up there in the first place, I’m sure that it was also locked.

    <br/><br/>

    At the end of the day, my verdict is a no-go to there being hauntings in Science Hall. I think it's more eerie as an
    architectural anomaly than the supposed supernatural forces in place. And in my opinion, there’s worse buildings to
    reside in on campus (see: crusty Computer Sciences building, the brutalist architecture of Mosse Humanities, or the
    archaic old elevator in Slichter Residence Hall).
