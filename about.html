    Some might wonder how we go to this point in our lives. Conspiracizing and testing Wisconsin lore. Well, let me take
    you back to 3 weeks ago when my roommates and I started watching murder mystery and haunted house reality series.
    That’s it. That’s the story. That’s all it took to push me over the edge and want to do it too. So here I am,
    working with what I got. The Wisco Wanderers is made up of some friends I rounded up for various excursions, the few shillings we have pooled together, a decomposing old
    car, and a dream.
